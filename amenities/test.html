<p>While they may have recently <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/study-ranks-tampa-as-americas-sweatiest-city/2234899" target="_blank">topped the charts of "Sweatiest Cities,"</a> the USDA still ranks Tampa and Miami as some of the best areas to live in Florida.

<p>The scale takes into account six metrics including seasonal climate, topography and water area. It's purpose is to measure an area's physical features that "enhance the location as a place to live."
